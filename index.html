      <p>The staff at <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> have been working towards a <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/12/16/dashboard-update/">unified dashboard</a> to manage all your blogs in one place on any device. However, many users feel that it falls short of the classic dashboards, me included.</p>
      <p>I'm sure most people would be fine with this as long as we are given a choice of interface, and that that choice remains consistent through our experience. However, on <time datetime="2015-03-13">March 13, 2015</time>, the preference setting for the choice of editor, which was implemented by a cookie a link back to the classic editor, was removed. Cue the uproar of the mass of angry and frustrated users when their cookies expire. <a href="https://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/please-reinstate-the-option-of-choice-to-use-the-old-publishing-format">Pages of complaints</a> have been posted in the forums in response to the editor essentially being forced on us.</p>
      <p>If you're also displeased with the new editor and would like to continue using the classic editor, you'll be glad to know that there are a few workarounds. They are listed here in order of overall ease of installation and use.</p>

      <!-- Userscript -->
      <section id="userscript">
        <h1>Automatic redirect: using a user script</h1>
        <p>I argue that this is the easiest because the only hard part is the initial installation. After that, everything redirects automatically without your input and you can almost forget you're using a script.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Bookmarklet -->
      <section id="bookmarklet">
        <h1>Manual redirect: using a bookmarklet</h1>
      </section>

      <!-- Manual per-site bookmarks -->
      <section id="manual-bookmarks">
        <h1>Explicit request: using bookmarks for each site</h1>
        <p>This method is painstakingly tedious and time-consuming; I recommend using one of the methods above if you can. This is included here for completeness, especially because it's the only officially endorsed solution.</p>
