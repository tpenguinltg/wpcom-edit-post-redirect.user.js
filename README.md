# wpcom-post-redirect.user.js
[WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) has removed the preference to edit posts using the classic interface. This user script forces a redirect to the classic interface when the new edit interface is visited.

## Installation
If you don't already have one, install [a browser extension](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) that allows you to run user scripts. Then, visit the URL below:
[https://github.com/tpenguinltg/wpcom-edit-post-redirect.user.js/raw/master/wpcom-edit-post-redirect.user.js]()

## Known Issues
* The new interface will start loading and appear before the redirect occurs
